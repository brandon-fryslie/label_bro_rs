# Roadmap for Label Bro Rust Implementation

## Phase 1: Frontend Development

### 1. User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Enhance the frontend with better styling and user experience.
- [ ] Add more interactive elements for printer selection and settings.

### 2. Basic Features
- [x] Implement basic HTTP server using Actix Web.
- [x] Set up routes for `/`, `/printLabels`, `/previewLabels`, `/aiGenerate`, `/printImage`, and `/discoverPrinters`.
- [x] Implement handlers for each route with basic functionality.

## Phase 2: Stub Backend Implementation

### 1. Label Printing
- [ ] Implement stub logic for label creation and printing.
- [ ] Ensure label previews are generated and returned as base64 images.

## Phase 3: Python Bridge Integration

### 1. Label Printing
- [ ] Integrate with printer utilities to send print instructions using Python bridge.

## Phase 4: Future Enhancements

### 1. Multiple Printer Support
- [ ] Refactor printer utilities to handle multiple printers.
- [ ] Allow selection of printer from the frontend.

### 2. Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Improve error handling across all routes.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize image processing and printing logic for better performance.
- [ ] Consider asynchronous processing for long-running tasks.

### 4. User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Enhance the frontend with better styling and user experience.
- [ ] Add more interactive elements for printer selection and settings.

### 5. Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Complete documentation for all modules and functions.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Phase 3: Additional Features

### 1. Advanced AI Features
- [ ] Explore additional AI capabilities for image and label generation.
- [ ] Implement user-configurable AI settings.

### 2. Cross-Platform Support
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with different operating systems.
- [ ] Test and optimize for various environments.

### 3. Community and Contribution
- [ ] Set up guidelines for community contributions.
- [ ] Encourage feedback and feature requests from users.
