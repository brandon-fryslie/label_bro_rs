# Implementation Plan for Label Bro Rust Project

## Phase 1: Frontend Development

### 1. User Interface Improvements
- **Task**: Enhance the frontend with better styling and user experience.
  - **Details**: Use modern CSS frameworks to improve the UI, ensuring it is responsive and user-friendly.

- **Task**: Add more interactive elements for printer selection and settings.
  - **Details**: Implement JavaScript to dynamically update the UI based on user interactions.

## Phase 2: Stub Backend Implementation

### 1. Label Printing
- **Task**: Implement stub logic for label creation and printing.
  - **Details**: Create placeholder functions that simulate label creation and printing.

- **Task**: Ensure label previews are generated and returned as base64 images.
  - **Details**: Implement basic image processing logic to return placeholder images.

## Phase 3: Python Bridge Integration

### 1. Label Printing
- **Task**: Integrate with printer utilities to send print instructions using Python bridge.
  - **Details**: Implement the Python bridge to interact with the existing Python utilities.

## Phase 4: Future Enhancements

### 1. Multiple Printer Support
- **Task**: Refactor printer utilities to handle multiple printers.
  - **Details**: Modify `src/utils/printer.rs` to maintain a list of available printers and allow selection.

- **Task**: Allow selection of printer from the frontend.
  - **Details**: Update the frontend to include a dropdown for printer selection, and pass the selected printer to the backend.

### 2. Error Handling and Logging
- **Task**: Improve error handling across all routes.
  - **Details**: Use Actix Web's error handling capabilities to return detailed error messages.

- **Task**: Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
  - **Details**: Use the `log` crate to add logging throughout the application.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Task**: Optimize image processing and printing logic for better performance.
  - **Details**: Profile the application and optimize bottlenecks, possibly using parallel processing.

- **Task**: Consider asynchronous processing for long-running tasks.
  - **Details**: Use Rust's async capabilities to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main thread.

### 4. User Interface Improvements
- **Task**: Enhance the frontend with better styling and user experience.
  - **Details**: Use modern CSS frameworks to improve the UI, ensuring it is responsive and user-friendly.

- **Task**: Add more interactive elements for printer selection and settings.
  - **Details**: Implement JavaScript to dynamically update the UI based on user interactions.

### 5. Documentation and Testing
- **Task**: Complete documentation for all modules and functions.
  - **Details**: Use Rust's documentation comments to provide detailed explanations of each module and function.

- **Task**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.
  - **Details**: Use the `actix-web` test utilities to write tests for each route and handler.

## Phase 3: Additional Features

### 1. Advanced AI Features
- **Task**: Explore additional AI capabilities for image and label generation.
  - **Details**: Research and integrate new AI models or APIs that enhance image generation capabilities.

- **Task**: Implement user-configurable AI settings.
  - **Details**: Allow users to configure AI settings via the frontend, and pass these settings to the backend.

### 2. Cross-Platform Support
- **Task**: Ensure compatibility with different operating systems.
  - **Details**: Test the application on various OSes and make necessary adjustments for compatibility.

- **Task**: Test and optimize for various environments.
  - **Details**: Ensure the application performs well in different network and hardware environments.

### 3. Community and Contribution
- **Task**: Set up guidelines for community contributions.
  - **Details**: Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for contributing to the project.

- **Task**: Encourage feedback and feature requests from users.
  - **Details**: Set up a platform for users to submit feedback and feature requests, such as GitHub Issues.
