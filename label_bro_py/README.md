# label_bro

Generate labels to print on your Brother QL-800 Label Printer

This app was written almost entirely by ChatGPT as an exercise in how well a custom GPT configured to be an expert at a 
particular python library would perform.  I would say it cut the time to develop in at least 1/2, although I did spend 
a decent amount of time on it.  But rendering live client-size previews were added by ChatGPT in one step (an additional
step was used to tweak them and add debounce, etc).

I did of course have to learn how all of it worked to fix a couple subtle bugs.  :)

Note: this was written for a Brother QL-800 printer with 62mm tape.  However it should work (with minor tweaks) 
with any printer supported by this library: https://github.com/pklaus/brother_ql

## Usage

### pyenv

First we need a Python.  Don't use system python.  It can cause problems and it's old.  Instead, install `pyenv` via the following steps:

```shell
brew install pyenv
pyenv init
pyenv install 3.12
pyenv global 3.12
which python3
```

The following steps will assume you are using a standard non-system python installed via pyenv.

### venv

There are many more complicated ways to use venv so feel free to use one of them if you're familiar.

```shell
cd <repo>

# make a venv
python3 -m venv venv

# activate venv
. ./venv/bin/activate

# install brew dependencies
brew install cairo libusb

# symlink brew libs
ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib ~/lib

# install python dependencies
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# note: if pyusb is installed before libusb, remove and reinstall it
python3 -m pip uninstall pyusb; python3 -m pip install pyusb

# run the app
# Note: by default this makes the application available over the local network so you can use it from your phone or ipad
python3 -m label_bro.app

# you will see some text like this:
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5099
 * Running on http://192.168.7.83:5099

# open the webapp (this probably only works on MacOS, for other OSes paste the url into your browser)
# Note: the 127 address will only work on the machine hosting the application.  Use the 192 address for network access
open http://127.0.0.1:5099
## Running Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover label_bro/tests
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided shell script to run all tests:

```bash
./bin/run_tests.sh
```

Now type some stuff into the text field.  A few seconds after you stop typing, the previews will appear.

Enter multiple lines for multiple labels.  Use the `my-text; 5` syntax to print multiple labels.  Note you will be unable to print labels
containing a semicolon and whitespace is not significant (`my-text:5` is equivalent to `my-text:       5`).

Press the big `Print` button to print your labels.  The printer must be connected to the host via USB and powered on.

Note: you can prevent your printer from turning off automatically after an hour by using Brother's firmware updater app.

### system python

Don't bother using system python.  Just install `pyenv`, install a python (e.g., `pyenv install 3.12`), then
use that globally (e.g., `pyenv global 3.12`).  Make sure to insert the pyenv code into your .zshrc file (run `pyenv init`, paste the non-comment lines into your .zshrc file) and open a new shell.

It is not recommended you do this.  Run `python3 -m pip install venv` to install the virtualenv package and follow the venv instructions.

If you really want to, just run `python3 -m label_bro.app` repeatedly and install whatever dependencies it complains about until it works.
The instructions may vary based on OS.

### Functionality

Python serves a small flask app.  This flask app has endpoints which use the `brother_ql` python library for direct communication
with the printer.  The app provides an interface to print very specifically formatted labels.

I tend to print 2 labels for each bin: one "full width" label, and one "small" label.  The full width label is meant for
the face of the bin and should be visible from a distance.  The small label is for the lid and needs to fit without overlapping anything 
or it will peel off.

The app is able to do this pretty decently.  All full width labels will be split so each word is on a new line and take the fill width of the
62mm tape (with some margin).  The small label will be a maximum of ~24pt font and may be smaller if there is a long string of text.

The app consists of a multiline text field.  Each line will be default print 1 full width label and one small label.  Checkboxes
allow you to print only one or the other.

Additionally, there is a special syntax that allows printing multiple labels on a per label basis.  Entering 'Random Crap; 5' will print
5x labels with the text "Random Crap".  This respects the checkbox state.  If both are checked, you will get 10x labels total.  Otherwise 5x of whatever is checked.

As you type, a preview of the label will be generated and displayed in the browser.  Make sure your printer is on, click the button, and inshallah you'll have some labels!

Errors will most likely be displayed in the webui, but this is not guaranteed.  See the app logs (stderr) for more potential errors.

## Structure

Most of the files are boilerplate and uninteresting.

ChatGPT initially generated all of the code in one single file.  At a certain size, it
became impractical to keep it in one file so I had ChatGPT split it up, generate an appropriate python module structure,
and then I would feed it specific files/functions to work on rather than the entire codebase.  But it should be possible to
continually feed the entire codebase to ChatGPT as well with a bit of tooling.

The important files are:
- label_bro/static/app.js
- label_bro/templates/index.html
- label_bro/app.py
- label_bro/utils/label_creation.py
- label_bro/utils/printer_utils.py

Less important but still used is:
- label_bro/static/css/style.css
- requirements.txt

Besides `setup.py`, the other files are likely not even used in any way (ChatGPT generated the entire structure).
